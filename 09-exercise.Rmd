# Task 1: Reflection

* The principle of proportional ink: The sizes of shaded areas in a visualization need to be proportional to the data values they represent.
* It is perfectly valid to use bars or shaded areas to show differences between conditions, as long as we make it explicit which differences we are showing.
* When bars are drawn on a log scale, they represent ratios and need to be drawn starting from 1, not 0. 
* Use direct labeling instead of colors when you need to distinguish between more than about eight categorical items. 


# Task 2: Annotations

```{r load-libraries-data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
# Load data here
usaarrests <- USArrests %>% 
    rownames_to_column('state') %>%
    mutate(murder_edges = ifelse(Murder > 15 | Murder < 2.5, TRUE, FALSE),
           is_max = ifelse(Murder > 15, TRUE, FALSE))

ggplot(usaarrests, 
       aes(x = UrbanPop, y = Assault, color = Rape)) +
    geom_point(size = 3) +
    geom_label_repel(data = filter(usaarrests, murder_edges == TRUE),
                     aes(label = state, fill = is_max),
                     color = "white") +
    theme_bw(base_family = "IBM Plex Sans") +
    theme(legend.position = 'bottom', 
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c(name = 'NÂº of Rape arrests\n(per 100k)') +
    guides(
        fill = FALSE
    ) +
    labs(
        title = 'USA Arrests (1973)',
        subtitle = 'Labeled points are in the extremes\nof murder arrests (per 100k)',
        caption = 'Lower number of murder arrests\nare labeled red, highest are labeled blue',
        x = 'Urban Population', 
        y = 'Number of Assault arrests (per 100k)'
    ) +
    annotate(geom = "curve", x = 84, xend = 81, y = 225, yend = 248, color = "#FF851B", 
             curvature = -0.5, arrow = arrow(angle = 15, length = unit(0.5, "lines"))) +
    annotate(geom = 'text', x = 88, y = 219, color = "#FF851B",
             label = "Nevada has the highest\namount of rape arrests")
```

Do the following:

1. Make a plot. Any kind of plot will do (though it might be easiest to work with `geom_point()`).

2. Label (some or all of) the points using one of `geom_text()`, `geom_label()`, `geom_text_repel()`, or `geom_label_repel()`. You might need to make a new indicator variable so that you only highlight a few of the points instead of all of them.

3. Add *at least two each** the following annotations somewhere on the plot using `annotate()`:

    - **Text**
    - **An arrow** (make a curved arrow for bonus fun)
    - **A rectangle**
    
    You can add more if you want, but those three are the minimum. Try to incorporate the annotations into the design of the plot rather than just placing them wherever.

Good luck and have fun!
